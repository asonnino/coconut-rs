// TODOs:

	- move params to other file because go is really bitchy about cyclic imports 
	- finish up the scheme (kinda obvious lol)
	- change SVDW map to increment and check for rust compatibility
	- figure out which places should use Affine points rather than Jacobian
	- clean-up errors
	- tests
